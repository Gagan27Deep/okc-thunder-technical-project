help me deploy my okc thunder technical project to railway. i have a django backend with postgresql database and an angular frontend already working locally. need to:

1. set up railway project with postgres database
2. deploy backend service with proper database connection variables
3. deploy frontend service with correct backend url configured
4. load my local database export into railway postgres
5. generate public urls for both services

guide me through the railway web interface and cli commands step by step. troubleshoot any deployment errors that come up, especially with domain generation and database connection issues.

the backend needs these environment variables connected to postgres: database_url, pgdatabase, pghost, pgpassword, pgport, pguser, and django_settings_module.

the frontend needs the backend public url added to environment.prod.ts before deployment.

help me update submission.md with the final deployed frontend url once everything is working.
