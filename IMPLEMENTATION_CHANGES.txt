OKC THUNDER TECHNICAL PROJECT - IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES DOCUMENTATION
=====================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
-----------------
This document outlines all changes made to complete the OKC Thunder technical internship project.
The project implements a full-stack basketball statistics application with Django backend and Angular frontend.

PART 1: DATABASE & BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION
==========================================

1. DATABASE SETUP (PostgreSQL)
-------------------------------
- Created PostgreSQL database: "okc"
- Created database user: "okcapplicant" with password "okcthunder"
- Database runs on localhost:5432

2. DJANGO MODELS (backend/app/dbmodels/models.py)
--------------------------------------------------
Created 6 normalized database models:

a) Team Model:
   - Stores team information
   - Primary key: team_id
   - Fields: team_id, name

b) Game Model:
   - Stores game information
   - Primary key: game_id
   - Fields: game_id, date
   - Foreign key: team_id (references Team)

c) Player Model:
   - Stores player information
   - Primary key: player_id
   - Fields: player_id, name
   - Foreign key: team_id (references Team)

d) Shot Model:
   - Stores individual shot attempts
   - Primary key: id
   - Fields: id, points, shooting_foul_drawn, shot_loc_x, shot_loc_y, action_type
   - Foreign keys: player_id (references Player), game_id (references Game)

e) Pass Model:
   - Stores passing attempts
   - Primary key: id
   - Fields: id, completed_pass, potential_assist, turnover, ball_start_loc_x,
             ball_start_loc_y, ball_end_loc_x, ball_end_loc_y, action_type
   - Foreign keys: player_id (references Player), game_id (references Game)

f) Turnover Model:
   - Stores turnover events
   - Primary key: id
   - Fields: id, tov_loc_x, tov_loc_y, action_type
   - Foreign keys: player_id (references Player), game_id (references Game)

Database Schema Design:
- Normalized to 3NF (Third Normal Form)
- Eliminates data redundancy from raw JSON files
- Uses foreign keys to maintain referential integrity
- Custom db_table names for clean table naming

3. DATA LOADING SCRIPT (backend/scripts/load_data.py)
------------------------------------------------------
Created idempotent data loading script that:
- Reads JSON files from backend/raw_data/
- Uses update_or_create() for idempotent loading (can run multiple times safely)
- Loads data in correct order to respect foreign key constraints:
  1. Teams (10 teams)
  2. Games (39 games)
  3. Players (10 players)
  4. Shots (192 shots)
  5. Passes (165 passes)
  6. Turnovers (14 turnovers)

Usage: python backend/scripts/load_data.py

4. API HELPER FUNCTIONS (backend/app/helpers/players.py)
---------------------------------------------------------
Implemented two main functions:

a) get_player_summary_stats(player_id):
   - Queries database for all player statistics
   - Aggregates data by action type (Pick & Roll, Isolation, Post-Up, Off-Ball Screen)
   - Calculates totals for shots, points, fouls, passes, assists, turnovers
   - Returns comprehensive player statistics dictionary

b) get_ranks(player_id, stats):
   - Calculates player rankings across all statistics
   - Uses count-based ranking (counts how many players have better stats)
   - Returns rank dictionary for all stats (lower number = better rank)

5. API ENDPOINT (backend/app/views.py)
---------------------------------------
Modified existing endpoint:
- GET /player/<player_id>/summary
- Returns player summary stats with rankings
- Format: {"apiResponse": {...player stats...}}

6. DATABASE EXPORT
-------------------
Created: backend/scripts/dbexport.pgsql
- Complete PostgreSQL dump of all schemas and data
- Can be used to recreate database on deployment server
- Generated using: pg_dump -U okcapplicant okc > dbexport.pgsql

PART 2: FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION
================================

1. TYPESCRIPT INTERFACES (frontend/src/app/player-summary/player-summary.interface.ts)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Created TypeScript interfaces matching API response:

a) PlayerSummary interface:
   - Main interface for player statistics
   - Includes all totals and rankings
   - Contains nested ActionStats objects

b) ActionStats interface:
   - Statistics broken down by action type
   - Fields: shotAttempts, points, foulsSuffered, completedPasses,
            potentialAssists, turnovers

c) Shot interface:
   - Individual shot data for visualization
   - Fields: loc (x, y coordinates), points

d) Pass interface:
   - Individual pass data
   - Fields: completed_pass, potential_assist, turnover, start_loc, end_loc

e) Turnover interface:
   - Individual turnover data
   - Fields: loc (x, y coordinates)

2. COMPONENT LOGIC (frontend/src/app/player-summary/player-summary.component.ts)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Updated component to:
- Fetch real data from API endpoint
- Handle loading states
- Default to player ID 0 on initialization
- Allow user to load different players
- Store player summary data for template display

3. COMPONENT TEMPLATE (frontend/src/app/player-summary/player-summary.component.html)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Created comprehensive UI with:

a) Player Input Section:
   - Input field for player ID
   - Load Player button

b) Player Header:
   - Displays player name and ID
   - Shows current rank out of 10 players

c) Overall Statistics Cards:
   - Total Shot Attempts (with rank)
   - Total Points (with rank)
   - Shooting Fouls Suffered (with rank)
   - Total Completed Passes (with rank)
   - Potential Assists (with rank)
   - Turnovers (with rank)

d) Shot Chart Visualization:
   - SVG-based basketball half-court
   - Green circles for made shots (2pt, 3pt, free throws)
   - Red X marks for missed shots
   - Coordinate mapping from feet to pixels
   - Legend explaining colors

e) Action Type Breakdown:
   - Four sections: Pick & Roll, Isolation, Post-Up, Off-Ball Screen
   - Each shows: Shot Attempts, Points, Fouls, Passes, Assists, Turnovers

4. COMPONENT STYLES (frontend/src/app/player-summary/player-summary.component.scss)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added styling with:
- OKC Thunder color scheme (#003d7a blue, #ff6600 orange)
- Responsive grid layouts
- Card-based design for statistics
- Professional typography
- Basketball court visualization styling

5. NODE.JS COMPATIBILITY FIX
-----------------------------
Created: frontend/start-frontend.bat
- Fixes Node.js v22 compatibility with Angular 12
- Sets NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
- Runs npm start

Usage: Run start-frontend.bat instead of npm start
